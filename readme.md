# Lambda UI

Lambda UI aims to provide base UI components that abstracts some of the rough edges of web components development with very little opinion.

*This project is pretty much a proof of concept at this stage.*

## Philosophy

- Be opionated as little as possible
- Don't implement a component for every html element
- Use html5 standard elements behavior whenever possible
- Be agnostic of the CSS approach
- Don't re-invent mobile native UI for web components
